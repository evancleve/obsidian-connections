# Obsidian Connections

This plugin allows you to define and view named connections between your notes. 

To add a connection, use the "Connections: Add a connection to another note" command.

In the resulting modal, fill in the type of connection you want to define between the notes and select the target note. Once added, all connections will be displayed in the Connections pane in the right sidebar.

If you want to delete a connection, click on the trash icon beside the connection you want to remove.

You can also add mapped connection types, which allow you to define relationships using pre-existing properties in your notes. For example, you could define a connection type of _"is the child of"_ for the _"parent"_ property.

This plugin plays nicely with the Folder Notes plugin.
